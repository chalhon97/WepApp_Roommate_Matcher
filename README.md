# Room Matching Website - Personal Project

This is a personal project I undertook where I built a funcional and responsive web application using HTML, CSS, Jquery and Sinatra that will take user data from a form and use it to match with a potential roommate.

The website has never been hosted which is why there is no link. It was simply for creative purposes.
